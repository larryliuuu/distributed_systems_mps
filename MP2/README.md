# Instructions for using Key-value Store system:


## Startup 
Startup the program on nodes using: "python node.py"

## System rules
Nodes can be started at any time in any order. Your hased key and node # are printed for your reference.
Keep in mind that there must be at least 3 nodes active for the system to function properly, and there can be at most 2 simultaneous failures.

Once the Key-value Store system banner prints, you are ready to send commands.
Commands are sent using the normal syntax for the assignment. 

## Creating node failure
To kill a node, we recommend using "Ctrl + \" to fully stop the node. 
Keys will be autobalanced after every failure and new node joining.
