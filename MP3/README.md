# Distributed Transactions

### BOOTUP

Our system has three types of nodes: Clients, servers, and a Coordinator.
The Coordinator must be booted first on VM9. After this, the clients and servers can be booted in any order, but Clients should be booted on VM's 1-3,
and servers on VM's 4-8.

### RUNNING CODE

The user can input commands from any client. The list of commands and their formats can be found on the MP3 description page. 

### DEBUGGING
You can type "storage" at any server to print its current key-value pairs in permanent storage.
